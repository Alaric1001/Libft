# Libft
The libft is initially a bunch of reimplemented stdlib functions. It has now evolved in a great panel of utility functions that I use daily in the majority of my school projects.

## Build

Just build with `make` and then you can use freely `libft.a`

## Initial set of functions

* memset
* bzero
* memcpy
* memccpy
* memmove
* memchr
* memcmp
* strlen
* strdup
* strcpy
* strncpy
* strcat
* strncat
* strlcat
* strchr
* strrchr
* strstr
* strnstr
* strcmp
* strncmp
* atoi
* isalpha
* isdigit
* isalnum
* isascii
* isprint
* toupper
* tolower
